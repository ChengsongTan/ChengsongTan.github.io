Section 3.2.4.2.4 CXL.cache Write says:
 <blockquote cite= 
"https://www.computeexpresslink.org/download-the-specification
"> 
<h3>  <font color = navy> 3.2.4.2.4 CLFlush </font> </h3>
...
The Host considers a write to be done once it has received all 64 bytes of data, and has sent the GO-I response message.
...
</blockquote>
This leaves the impression that GO and the pulled Data always come in pairs. However, there is one exception where CleanEvictNoData 
does not require a piece of Data to be returned. In that case, just the GO-I being sent would suffice as a sign of transaction completeness for the Host.

<h2>Tentative suggestion </h2>

We propose the following text to be added to avoid any confusion about CleanEvictNoData's transaction flows (and when it was considered complete):
<blockquote cite= 
"https://www.computeexpresslink.org/download-the-specification
"> 
<h3>  <font color = navy>Section 3.2.4.2.4 CXL.cache Write </font> </h3>
...
The Host considers a write to be done once it has received all 64 bytes of data, and has sent the GO-I response message.
<b>In the case where only a GO-I is required (i.e. CleanEvictNoData), 
	just the GO message being sent would be enough for the Host to consider a write done.</b>
	...
</blockquote>
